                <p>The research interests of our collaboratory are (1) to develop novel platforms to conduct large-scale, distributed simulations of processes such as epidemics and evolution, (2) to create the algorithms and tools needed to run such simulations and visualize the results, (3) to use the data and insights derived from these models and simulations to engage with a wider audience through science education, collaboration with experts from other fields, and (4) to pursue of artistically-motivated projects that interrogate the nature of scientific research and its effects in the world and society at large.</p>
